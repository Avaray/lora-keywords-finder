# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è LoRA Keywords Picker for ForgeUI

This Extension lets you fetch keywords for your [LoRA](https://wiki.civitai.com/wiki/Low-Rank_Adaptation) models using [CivitAI API](https://developer.civitai.com/docs/api/public-rest).  
Created for [ForgeUI](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge) without plans to support other UIs.  
I was inspired by [this Redddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1gbjasv/automatic1111_and_loras_for_generation_is_there/).

## Installation

1. Open "Extensions" tab in ForgeUI.
2. Open "Install from URL" tab.
3. Paste the following URL: `https://github.com/Avaray/lora-keyword-picker`
4. Click "Install" button.
5. When the installation is done, reload UI.

## Usage

1. Extension will be visible in **txt2img** and **img2img** tabs as **LoRA Keywords Picker**.
2. Select LoRA file from the list.
3. Fetched keywords will be displayed in the text area near the list.

## Notes

- It only works with models that are available on [CivitAI](https://civitai.com/models).
- It only returns the keywords if author specified them in the model description.
- It saves the keywords on disk after fetching them for the first time. 
- If CivitAI API is down, you won't get any new keywords.
- I'm planning to add more features in the future.
